  <section>
    
    <h2>What is Gender Identity?</h2>
    <p>Gender identity is  an individual's self-conception as a man or woman, a boy or girl, a mix of man/boy and woman/girl, a person who fluctuates between man/boy and woman/girl, or a person who doesn't fit into any of those categories at all. It is distinct from biological sex, which refers to the persons assigned gender at birth.
   </p>
    <br>

    <h2> The Most Common Types of Gender Identities</h2>
