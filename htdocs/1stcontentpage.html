  <h1>THE DIFFERENT SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS</h1>
</header>

  <section>
    
    <h2>What is Sexual Orientation?</h2>
    <p>Sexual Orientation refers to the gender to which a person is attracted to. The way you identify, how you feel sexual and romantic attraction (if you do), and your interest in and preferences around sexual and romantic relationships are aspects of sexuality.  

    Keep in mind that sexuality is fluid, meaning it can change over time. Dating a certain gender at a given moment won’t fully define and restrict your sexuality.
   </p>
