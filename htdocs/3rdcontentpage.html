      <h4>Because of who they love, how they appear, or who they are, LGBTQIA+ people all across the world are subjected to violence and inequity, as well as torture and even execution. Sexual orientation and gender identity are important components of ourselves that should never be discriminated against.</h4>

      <h4> As you can see from the map above, there are still a lot of countries who don't have laws for same-sex relationships. It's even illegal in some countries. However, there are also countries that 
        have laws supporting the LGBTQIA+ community. We hope that one day, all the countries will allow same-sex marriage/union. </h4>
